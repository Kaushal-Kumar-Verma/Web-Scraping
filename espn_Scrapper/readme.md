I am  given the link of IPL 2020-2021 Home page link
https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2020-21-1210595
I needed to scrap the data using this link in the formate displayed below 


1. Create a folder of IPL 2020.
2. Inside that folder create folder for each team playing in that IPL. 
3. Create Cxcel file to each Batsman in that team folder
   in which we will store detail of the player in the form of array of object 
   where each object should describe a particular match played by a player.

Detail of an object include
   a. Run, Ball, Six, Four Strick Rate(sr) for that Match.
   b. Date, Vanue, Result, and apponent name for that Match.
